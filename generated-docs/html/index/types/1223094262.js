When omitted, tests are allowed to run forever.\n- `exit`: When `true`, the runner will exit the Node process after running tests. If `false`, the runner will merely return test results.\n- `failFast`: When `true`, first failed test stops the whole run.\n- `filterTree`: The spec tree goes through this function before execution. Can be used to filter out test cases, rearrange, annotate, etc.\n","hashAnchor":"t","info":{"tag":"typeSynonym","value":{"arguments":[],"type":{"tag":"TypeApp","annotation":null,"contents":[{"tag":"TypeConstructor","annotation":null,"contents":[["Prim"],"Record"]},{"tag":"RCons","annotation":null,"contents":["\u0000s\u0000l\u0000o\u0000w",{"tag":"TypeConstructor","annotation":null,"contents":[["Data","Time","Duration"],"Milliseconds"]},{"tag":"RCons","annotation":null,"contents":["\u0000t\u0000i\u0000m\u0000e\u0000o\u0000u\u0000t",{"tag":"TypeApp","annotation":null,"contents":[{"tag":"TypeConstructor","annotation":null,"contents":[["Data","Maybe"],"Maybe"]},{"tag":"TypeConstructor","annotation":null,"contents":[["Data","Time","Duration"],"Milliseconds"]}]},{"tag":"RCons","annotation":null,"contents":["\u0000e\u0000x\u0000i\u0000t",{"tag":"TypeConstructor","annotation":null,"contents":[["Prim"],"Boolean"]},{"tag":"RCons","annotation":null,"contents":["\u0000f\u0000a\u0000i\u0000l\u0000F\u0000a\u0000s\u0000t",{"tag":"TypeConstructor","annotation":null,"contents":[["Prim"],"Boolean"]},{"tag":"RCons","annotation":null,"contents":["\u0000f\u0000i\u0000l\u0000t\u0000e\u0000r\u0000T\u0000r\u0000e\u0000e",{"tag":"TypeConstructor","annotation":null,"contents":[["Test","Spec","Config"],"TreeFilter"]},{"tag":"REmpty","annotation":null}]}]}]}]}]}]}}},"moduleName":"Test.Spec.Config","name":"Config","packageInfo":{"tag":"package","value":"spec"},"score":2,"sourceSpan":{"end":{"column":4,"line":30},"name":".spago/p/spec-8.1.1/src/Test/Spec/Config.purs","start":{"column":1,"line":24}}}]
